Implemented the search UI on the index page with client-side `/api/search` fetching and result rendering, updated index page tests, and recorded the pattern/PRD/progress updates in `src/claude_code_transcripts/__init__.py`, `tests/test_index_page.py`, `AGENTS.md`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`, and `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`.  
Checks: `python -m pytest` failed because pytest isn’t installed.  
Branch: couldn’t create `ralph/conversation-search-fuzzy-match` due to “Operation not permitted” when writing `.git/refs/heads/ralph`.  
Browser verification: `dev-browser` skill isn’t available in this environment, so I couldn’t complete the required UI verification.  
No commit created because checks didn’t pass.

Next steps:
1. Install pytest and rerun `python -m pytest`.
2. Create/switch to `ralph/conversation-search-fuzzy-match` with permissions that allow writing `.git/refs`.
3. Verify the UI in a browser (per the dev-browser requirement).
